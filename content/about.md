I am a backend engineer, a problem solver with extensive experience in
application design and development. I am a fast learner, focusing on
acquiring fundamental knowledge and on how technologies work to achieve a high
level of understanding.

I have used a wide range of technologies and programming languages.

I am actively involved in designing and implementing features,
process automation, infrastructure and the product direction.

I am interested in:

* application and system design and development, distributed systems and coordination, big data processing
* Golang, Python

I have worked remotely for 7+ years. Video conferences and business group chats are second nature to me.

Check out my [resume](/cv/) for more details.

I live in [Craiova, Romania](https://goo.gl/maps/cddmJ4ihbTyzFJks7) with my wife and two padawans.

When I'm not tinkering with technologies, I enjoy playing with my kids, reading scifi & fantasy books, playing board games, traveling and snowboarding.
